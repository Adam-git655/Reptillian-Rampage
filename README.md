**Reptilian Rampage**

Made for GMTK Jam 2024 (Team Project - 2 People)

This is a tower defense game. In this game, you are assigned the task of protecting the legendary dragon lair made of scales. Enemy reptile forces are attacking this lair in order to steal these valuable scales and destroy the dragon lair. To avoid this, you have to deploy reptilian troops throughout the battlefield which use their scales to attack the enemies. Every enemy reptile killed will give you their scales which you can use to deploy even more reptilian troops. You have to survive 5 waves of enemies in order to win the game

**My contribution:-**

I primarily worked on the programming and art aspects of the game. I drew most of the sprites present in the game. I also worked on all tower defense mechanics, such as placing the reptiles, handling their attacks, etc.
